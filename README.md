# Accounting Functions with Python

This repository is an attempt to automate some accounting tasks and give some time to accounts to carry out other strategic functions. The various functions I would try to create with python includes the following:

1. Preparing the income statement, balance sheet and notes from the trial balance
2. Preparing loan amortisation tables for various loans 
3. Ratio analysis (Profitability ratio, Solvency ratio, Efficiency ratio and Leverage ratio)

# Prepare a more detailed financial statement from the trial balance. 

For now, I am focused on the Income statement and balance sheet. The idea is to prepare the income statement and balance sheet and save it as an excel file. Owing to the fact that one can't get all the information that goes into the notes to the account from the trial balance, the easiest thing one can do is to generate the notes to all the various line items based on the account subclass specified in the trial balance and save this to the excel file. Those notes to the account that needs further information such as PPE reconciliation will be done manually. However, those notes such as Revenue, cost of sales, operating expenses can be automatically generated from the trial balance as long as they are mapped to the right account class.
