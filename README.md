# Accounting Functions with Python

This repository is an attempt to automate some accounting tasks and give some time to accounts to carry out other strategic functions. The various functions I would try to create with python includes the following:

1. Preparing the income statement, balance sheet and notes from the trial balance
2. Preparing loan amortisation tables for various loans 
3. Ratio analysis (Profitability ratio, Solvency ratio, Efficiency ratio and Leverage ratio)
4. Any other accounting function which is done regularly/repeatedly

# Prepare a more detailed financial statement from the trial balance. 

For now, I am focused on the Income statement and balance sheet. The idea is to prepare the income statement and balance sheet and save it as an excel file. Owing to the fact that one can't get all the information that goes into the notes to the account from the trial balance, the easiest thing one can do is to generate the notes to all the various line items based on the account subclass specified in the trial balance and save this to the excel file. Those notes to the account that needs further information such as PPE reconciliation will be done manually. However, those notes such as Revenue, cost of sales, operating expenses can be automatically generated from the trial balance as long as they are mapped to the right account class.

# Ongoing
1. Notes to the account

# Completed
1. Income statement
2. Balance sheet

# Not started
1. Amortisation Table
2. Ratio Analysis

# Considerations
1. Should the User round the trial balance first before using the function? This will avoid the rounding error.
2. Include a check in the balance sheet to confirm if it is balanced
3. Can this functions be converted into an application so that others can use it?

### This repository will be updated over time as more functions are built.
